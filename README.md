# A* Search Algoritm
Welcome to this interactive application that uses the A algorithm* to find the shortest path between two points on a grid. Follow the detailed steps below to make the most of its features:

## 1. Mark the Start and End Points
* Start Point (Green):
Select a cell on the grid by clicking with the left mouse button. This cell will represent the starting location for the pathfinding algorithm.
* End Point (Red):
After setting the start point, click on another cell with the left mouse button to define the endpoint, or destination, for the path.

## 2. Place Barriers on the Grid
To simulate obstacles, you can add barriers using the middle mouse button (scroll wheel button). Hereâ€™s how:
* Hold down the middle button and move across the cells where you want to place barriers.
* Cells marked as barriers will become inaccessible zones, and the A* algorithm will find a route that avoids them.
Barriers are represented by black cells and cannot be traversed.

## 3. Calculate the Shortest Path
Once the start point, endpoint, and barriers are set, the application will automatically run the A algorithm*. This algorithm:
* Analyzes all possible routes from the start point to the end point.
* Finds and highlights the shortest path, avoiding the placed barriers.
* Visited Nodes (Dark Blue): Nodes that have been fully explored.
* Reviewed Nodes (Light Blue): Nodes that have been considered but not fully explored.

## 4. Experiment with Different Configurations
* You can modify the grid at any time. Change the start, end, or barrier locations to see how the algorithm adapts to different configurations.
* Try different barrier arrangements to observe how the algorithm finds the best path in each scenario.
